A collection of the codes I designed while I was in the Young Technology Scholars Program in 2020.

Maze_Game: A maze game I designed out of mere numnbers where the 1's depicted the walls and the 0's depicted the free-to-move spaces. 
There were two 5's, one for the starting and one for the ending position. Using WASD you can navigate the icon (5) to the end without htting any walls.

Nim_Game: Nim is a mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns removing (or "nimming") objects from distinct heaps or piles. On each turn, a player must remove at least one object, and may remove any number of objects provided they all come from the same heap or pile. Depending on the version being played, the goal of the game is either to avoid taking the last object or to take the last object. The program i've made is a recreation of the ancient game.

Snake_Game: A basic snake game in which the snake has to avoid hitting itself and must collect a randomly spawning object to progress further. This project was made so that the snake could be controlled with a sensor. During the summer camp, using wires and sensors I had created a temporary joystick with which I could play the game.
